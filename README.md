A terminal based typing game written in haskell.

## Note
Due to the use of [hSetBuffering](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.19.1.0/docs/System-IO.html#v:hSetBuffering), this only works on Linux and MacOS.

Requires the following packages:
- [Random](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/random)
- [Time](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time)
